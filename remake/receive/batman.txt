NARRATOR: A tranquil
day in Gotham City.

And what could
be more soothing...

than a couple of hours
in Minerva's Mineral Spa?

For a millionaire who does nothing but count
money, Mr. Wayne, you stay in fair condition.

Oh, I try to keep pretty active
with falconry and spelunking.

And you people here at Minerva's
Mineral Spa keep me in pretty good shape.

Well, that'll about
do it for you, sir.

Unless, of course, you'd like one of Minerva's
Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massages.

No, I've got to get dressed
and get out of here. Thank you.

NARRATOR: But for another
millionaire not so pressed for time...

the renowned scalp
massage of Minerva...

one of Gotham City's most
beautiful and glamorous women...

is about to produce
some amazing results.

Tell me, darling...

how did you collect that
divine fortune of yours?

By never taking a beautiful
woman at face value, Minerva.

Ha, ha. Tell me
some more, darling.

Tell me, where do
you keep that fortune?

[MACHINE WHIRRING]

Two million dollars' worth
of negotiable securities...

in the grandfather's
clock, of course.

Well, of course.

There you are, darling.

Atlas, put Mr. Dozier into
my perfumed pressurizer.

NARRATOR: And still
another millionaire...

Tell me, darling...

how did you become a
rich television producer?

By never hiring
method actors, Minerva.

And by always ignoring
network executives.

Tell me some more.

Where do you keep
that lovely loot of yours?

[MACHINE WHIRRING]

In the television
set, of course.

But of course.

MINERVA: Here you are, darling.

I hope you enjoyed
your treatment.

Minerva, after every visit to your
spa, I always feel like a new man.

Hmm. I feel like a
new man too, Bruce.

SAM: Bruce. Bruce Wayne.

- Hello, Sam. How are you?
- Thank you.

My wife was thrilled to get that invitation
to the private Wayne Foundation showing...

of the greatest
diamonds next week.

A very interesting affair. Most of
the major stones are here already.

Under lock and key, I hope.

Oh, yes, they're quite safe in
the Wayne Foundation vault.

SAM: Ah. Oh, Minerva, has my
wife shown up to pick me up yet?

I'll check with Aphrodite.

Anything wrong, darling?

I thought I left my
wristwatch in this box.

Aphrodite, did
Mr. Shubert's wife arrive yet?

She's in the waiting
room. This way, please.

- Thank you. Minerva, Bruce, I'll see you later.
- Yes, goodbye, Sam.

You were saying?

Oh, it's nothing. I must have
been mistaken. Good day.

Come back soon, darling.

Those emeralds, Minerva...

they were in Mrs. Carson's
cookie jar, just like you said.

Of course they were, but I'm no
longer interested in the emeralds.

Now that I have a way to get
into the Wayne Foundation vault.

- That watch.
- Yes, that watch.

With this watch, I'm going to have my
hands on the world's largest diamonds.

And thus glorious,
glamorous, glittering power.

Freddie, I have some
fast fencing for you to do.

I am not known as, in fact, "French
Freddie the Fence" for nothing, Minerva.

Shortly, I'll have the combination
of the Wayne Foundation vault...

and then you'll have the
world's largest diamonds to fence.

Famous diamonds are
not easy to fence, Minerva.

Heh. If I can get
them, Freddie...

you can fence them.

[FREDDIE CHUCKLES]

Frankly, I'm stumped.

And only Mr. Dozier knew those securities
were in that grandfather's clock.

And Mr. Horwitz's
cash out of his  TV set.

But someone else stole
them, commissioner.

Right, and Mrs. Shubert's
pearls out of her tea urn...

and Mr. Converse's
bonds out of a sleeping bag.

Well, if you ask me,
millionaires in this city...

certainly choose strange
hiding places for their valuables.

But known only to
themselves, Barbara.

Each swears no other soul
alive was in on their secret.

But we ought to let someone else
in on our problem, commissioner.

Your problem, Chief O'Hara...

is that leg of yours that you
sprained when playing Ping-Pong.

I'll take care of the little
things like stolen bonds...

and emeralds and securities.

You found my watch, Minerva?

Yes, Bruce. It must have fallen
out of the box when I unlocked it.

I'll send someone down for it.

Why don't you
come for it yourself?

[PHONE BEEPS]

- A special treat for you.
- A treat, Minerva? I'll be there shortly.

- One moment, sir.
- Yes, commissioner?

GORDON [OVER PHONE]:
Batman, we need your help.

which there is no explanation.

Millionaire William Dozier's securities

producer Howie Horwitz's

We'll be there as quickly as possible,
but first I have one errand to run.

- Did you hear that, d*ck?
- A bit.

Emeralds, cookie
jars, bonds and TV sets.

It's the victims that make this case intriguing
and unique. They're all immensely wealthy.

And they're all frequenters
of Minerva's Mineral Spa.

Gosh, Bruce. Would Minerva
stoop to something like that?

It's hard to believe,
d*ck. She's so beautiful...

and worth investigating.

- To the Batpoles?
- You to the Batpoles, d*ck.

I want you to take the Batmobile
with a spare Batsuit for me.

And I want you to meet me
in the alley behind the spa.

I'll take my own car
and be sure and find you.

Roger.

I came here to pick
up a wristwatch...

and I get a free Eggplant
Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massage.

That was my special
little treat, on the house...

because of that silly
misunderstanding over your watch.

going to take a minute.

Oh. That was marvelous, Minerva.

Heh. There you are, my darling.

Your root ends
are really glowing.

Here you are, darling.

Thank you.

for the special treatment, Minerva?

Seeing you again
was payment enough.

Lord Easystreet?

Hello, Easy. I haven't

I'll meet you in the

Batman and Robin should investigate further.

Yes, yes, 4:30 is good
enough for a scalp massage.

Tell Commissioner Gordon
that we might be detained.

Divine, darling, divine.

- How did it go, Minerva?
- Beautifully. But...

Hello.

We'd like the full
treatment, please.

Well, of course. Register

Although I'd be proud if
he were, this is not my son.

This is Robin, the Boy
Wonder. I'm Batman.

Well, I'm so sorry, I
couldn't recognize your face.

But your physique
was very familiar.

Check your valuables. After you've disrobed,
Adonis and Apollo are going to start you off.

We have no valuables to check.

And if we disrobed, we'd
reveal our secret true identities.

That's too bad. You can't get the full
value of my mineral spa fully dressed.

Our boots, leotards, gauntlets,
capes, cowls and even our utility belts...

are more permeable
than you might think.

Shall we start?

This way, gentlemen.

What's the matter, Minerva?

I don't know, but my female intuition
tells me there's something wrong.

I had the strange feeling
that millionaire Bruce Wayne...

was issuing instructions
through his watch.

- Huh?
- And Batman is a close friend of his.

Be sure that those dynamic
darlings get our full treatment.

Including some extra pressurizing
in my perfumed pressurizer.

Persimmon pressurizer, Minerva.

Call it whatever
you want, but do it...

while I'm going to the
Wayne Foundation vault.

Yes, I'm looking forward to Minerva's
famous Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massage.

Minerva thought you might pop them
into the persimmon pressurizer first.

Persimmon pressurizer?
Holy astringent plum-like fruit.

Only astringent
until ripe, Robin.

I think you'll find the experience
most palatable. This way, gentlemen.

Atlas, what's up?

Minerva wants them
permanently pressurized.

The experience may be palatable, Batman,
but I don't like the looks of this thing.

Me neither, Robin.

It's not how the pressurizer
looks that counts, Batman.

set, of course.

But of course.

MINERVA: Here you are, darling.

I hope you enjoyed
your treatment.

Minerva, after every visit to your
spa, I always feel like a new man.

Hmm. I feel like a
new man too, Bruce.

SAM: Bruce. Bruce Wayne.

- Hello, Sam. How are you?
- Thank you.

My wife was thrilled to get that invitation
to the private Wayne Foundation showing...

of the greatest
diamonds next week.

A very interesting affair. Most of
the major stones are here already.

Under lock and key, I hope.

Oh, yes, they're quite safe in
the Wayne Foundation vault.

SAM: Ah. Oh, Minerva, has my
wife shown up to pick me up yet?

I'll check with Aphrodite.

Anything wrong, darling?

I thought I left my
wristwatch in this box.

Aphrodite, did
Mr. Shubert's wife arrive yet?

She's in the waiting
room. This way, please.

- Thank you. Minerva, Bruce, I'll see you later.
- Yes, goodbye, Sam.

You were saying?

Oh, it's nothing. I must have
been mistaken. Good day.

Come back soon, darling.

Those emeralds, Minerva...

they were in Mrs. Carson's
cookie jar, just like you said.

Of course they were, but I'm no
longer interested in the emeralds.

Now that I have a way to get
into the Wayne Foundation vault.

- That watch.
- Yes, that watch.

With this watch, I'm going to have my
hands on the world's largest diamonds.

And thus glorious,
glamorous, glittering power.

Freddie, I have some
fast fencing for you to do.

I am not known as, in fact, "French
Freddie the Fence" for nothing, Minerva.

Shortly, I'll have the combination
of the Wayne Foundation vault...

and then you'll have the
world's largest diamonds to fence.

Famous diamonds are
not easy to fence, Minerva.

Heh. If I can get
them, Freddie...

you can fence them.

[FREDDIE CHUCKLES]

Frankly, I'm stumped.

And only Mr. Dozier knew those securities
were in that grandfather's clock.

And Mr. Horwitz's
cash out of his  TV set.

But someone else stole
them, commissioner.

Right, and Mrs. Shubert's
pearls out of her tea urn...

and Mr. Converse's
bonds out of a sleeping bag.

Well, if you ask me,
millionaires in this city...

certainly choose strange
hiding places for their valuables.

But known only to
themselves, Barbara.

Each swears no other soul
alive was in on their secret.

But we ought to let someone else
in on our problem, commissioner.

Your problem, Chief O'Hara...

is that leg of yours that you
sprained when playing Ping-Pong.

I'll take care of the little
things like stolen bonds...

and emeralds and securities.

You found my watch, Minerva?

Yes, Bruce. It must have fallen
out of the box when I unlocked it.

I'll send someone down for it.

Why don't you
come for it yourself?

[PHONE BEEPS]

- A special treat for you.
- A treat, Minerva? I'll be there shortly.

- One moment, sir.
- Yes, commissioner?

GORDON [OVER PHONE]:
Batman, we need your help.

About a rash of robberies for
which there is no explanation.

Millionaire William Dozier's securities
stolen out of a grandfather's clock...

oil heiress Camille Carson's
emeralds from her cookie jar...

producer Howie Horwitz's
cash out of his TV set.

We'll be there as quickly as possible,
but first I have one errand to run.

- Did you hear that, d*ck?
- A bit.

Emeralds, cookie
jars, bonds and TV sets.

It's the victims that make this case intriguing
and unique. They're all immensely wealthy.

And they're all frequenters
of Minerva's Mineral Spa.

Gosh, Bruce. Would Minerva
stoop to something like that?

It's hard to believe,
d*ck. She's so beautiful...

and worth investigating.

- To the Batpoles?
- You to the Batpoles, d*ck.

I want you to take the Batmobile
with a spare Batsuit for me.

And I want you to meet me
in the alley behind the spa.

I'll take my own car
and be sure and find you.

Roger.

I came here to pick
up a wristwatch...

and I get a free Eggplant
Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massage.

That was my special
little treat, on the house...

because of that silly
misunderstanding over your watch.

Now, this is only
going to take a minute.

[MACHINE WHIRRING]

The combination to the
Wayne Foundation vault?

Right seven times to eight...

left four times past six to 11.

Right twice to nine...

left to three, and open.

Oh. That was marvelous, Minerva.

Heh. There you are, my darling.

Your root ends
are really glowing.

Here you are, darling.

Thank you.

Are you sure I can't pay you anything
for the special treatment, Minerva?

Seeing you again
was payment enough.

[PHONE RINGS]

Excuse me.

Minerva's Mineral Spa.

Lord Easystreet?

Hello, Easy. I haven't
seen you for ages.

I'll meet you in the
alley in a moment.

I don't know what's up in here, but I suspect
Batman and Robin should investigate further.

Yes, yes, 4:30 is good
enough for a scalp massage.

Tell Commissioner Gordon
that we might be detained.

Divine, darling, divine.

- How did it go, Minerva?
- Beautifully. But...

Hello.

We'd like the full
treatment, please.

Well, of course. Register
for both yourself and your son.

Although I'd be proud if
he were, this is not my son.

This is Robin, the Boy
Wonder. I'm Batman.

Well, I'm so sorry, I
couldn't recognize your face.

But your physique
was very familiar.

Check your valuables. After you've disrobed,
Adonis and Apollo are going to start you off.

We have no valuables to check.

And if we disrobed, we'd
reveal our secret true identities.

That's too bad. You can't get the full
value of my mineral spa fully dressed.

Our boots, leotards, gauntlets,
capes, cowls and even our utility belts...

are more permeable
than you might think.

Shall we start?

This way, gentlemen.

What's the matter, Minerva?

I don't know, but my female intuition
tells me there's something wrong.

I had the strange feeling
that millionaire Bruce Wayne...

was issuing instructions
through his watch.

- Huh?
- And Batman is a close friend of his.

Be sure that those dynamic
darlings get our full treatment.

Including some extra pressurizing
in my perfumed pressurizer.

Persimmon pressurizer, Minerva.

Call it whatever
you want, but do it...

while I'm going to the
Wayne Foundation vault.

Yes, I'm looking forward to Minerva's
famous Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massage.

Minerva thought you might pop them
into the persimmon pressurizer first.

Persimmon pressurizer?
Holy astringent plum-like fruit.

Only astringent
until ripe, Robin.

I think you'll find the experience
most palatable. This way, gentlemen.

Atlas, what's up?

Minerva wants them
permanently pressurized.

The experience may be palatable, Batman,
but I don't like the looks of this thing.

Me neither, Robin.

It's not how the pressurizer
looks that counts, Batman.

Uh-huh.

It's how you're going
to look when you're in it.

And when it'sNARRATOR: A tranquil
day in Gotham City.

And what could
be more soothing...

than a couple of hours
in Minerva's Mineral Spa?

For a millionaire who does nothing but count
money, Mr. Wayne, you stay in fair condition.

Oh, I try to keep pretty active
with falconry and spelunking.

And you people here at Minerva's
Mineral Spa keep me in pretty good shape.

Well, that'll about
do it for you, sir.

Unless, of course, you'd like one of Minerva's
Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massages.

No, I've got to get dressed
and get out of here. Thank you.

NARRATOR: But for another
millionaire not so pressed for time...

the renowned scalp
massage of Minerva...

one of Gotham City's most
beautiful and glamorous women...

is about to produce
some amazing results.

Tell me, darling...

how did you collect that
divine fortune of yours?

By never taking a beautiful
woman at face value, Minerva.

Ha, ha. Tell me
some more, darling.

Tell me, where do
you keep that fortune?

[MACHINE WHIRRING]

Two million dollars' worth
of negotiable securities...

in the grandfather's
clock, of course.

Well, of course.

There you are, darling.

Atlas, put Mr. Dozier into
my perfumed pressurizer.

NARRATOR: And still
another millionaire...

Tell me, darling...

how did you become a
rich television producer?

By never hiring
method actors, Minerva.

And by always ignoring
network executives.

Tell me some more.

Where do you keep
that lovely loot of yours?
